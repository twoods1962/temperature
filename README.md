 Temperature lab

1. For the temperature lab weâ€™re going to create a temperature converter that:
    * Uses a form that:
        * Has an input that decides whether the conversion is Fahrenheit to Celsius or Vice Versa
        * Has input for the value to be converted
    * Displays the value in its original units and in the converted units
    * Has code that is well documented with comments, has good code structure, and follows naming conventions
    * Optionally: Make the temperature converter do multiple units, convert different types of units (meters to inches etc) and/or make it beautiful using HTML and CSS, or interactive using JavaScript.
2. Push your code to your repository.
